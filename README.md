---

## üöÄ Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/](https://github.com/)Cybercade/Cybercade-bot.git
    cd [Your Repo Name]
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configuration:**
    * Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    * Open the `.env` file and fill in the necessary environment variables:
        ```dotenv
        # Your Discord Bot Token (found in the Discord Developer Portal)
        BOT_TOKEN=YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN
        
        # (Optional) The ID of your test server (Guild ID) for quick deployment of slash commands during development
        DEV_GUILD_ID=YOUR_TEST_SERVER_ID
        ```
    * **IMPORTANT:** Never commit your `.env` file or your tokens to Git! It is already listed in `.gitignore`.

4.  **Compile the TypeScript code:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```

5.  **Start the bot:**
    * For production mode:
        ```bash
        npm start
        ```
    * For development mode with automatic restart on changes (using `ts-node-dev`):
        ```bash
        npm run dev
        ```

6.  **Register Slash Commands:**
    On the first start (or when new commands are added), slash commands need to be registered with Discord. This usually happens automatically at bot startup through `discordx`.

## üìñ Usage

**Cybercade Bot** primarily uses Slash Commands (`/`) for modern and intuitive operation.

### Music Commands (Examples):
* `/music play <song-name or YouTube-URL>`: Plays a song or adds it to the queue.
* `/music skip`: Skips the current song.
* `/music queue`: Displays the current queue.
* `/music pause`: Pauses playback. (TODO)
* `/music resume`: Resumes playback. (TODO)
* `/music stop`: Stops the music and clears the queue.

### RSS Feed Commands (Examples):
* `/rss add <feed-URL>`: Subscribes to an RSS feed and posts updates in the specified channel.
* `/rss remove <feed-ID>`: Removes an RSS feed subscription.
* `/rss list`: Displays all active RSS feed subscriptions on the server.

A complete list of all commands can be obtained with `/help` (if implemented).
